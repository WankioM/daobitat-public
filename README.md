## üîç The Problem

The real estate market, particularly in Kenya and across Africa, faces significant challenges:

- **Rampant Fraud**: 1 in every 5 real estate transactions is fraudulent
- **Time Inefficiency**: Acquiring a new home takes 2-5 months
- **Price Inflation**: Purchase prices are 5.2% higher than necessary (Hass Consult 2023)
- **Lack of Transparency**: Property owners struggle with visibility throughout transactions
- **Trust Deficit**: Unreliable verification systems leave buyers and renters vulnerable

These problems create friction, increase costs, and undermine trust in the real estate market.
